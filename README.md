## Origin and Overview:
* Clearbanc was founded in October 2015 by *Michele Romanow (from Dragon's Den), Andrew D’Souza, Ivan Gritsiniak, Charlie Feng, and Tanay Delima* with headquarters in Toronto, Canada. The idea behind the company is to *provide capital to entrepreneurs and founders* as quickly and efficiently as possible using AI so that they can use these funds for *customer acquisition, marketing and inventory funding*. Clearbanc does this without taking any equity from the company but instead takes a fixed percentage of their sales until the money is paid back plus a 6% fee. They advertise themselves as a company made by founders for founders. To date Clearbanc has raised close to *552 million dollars in three funding rounds*.

## Business Activities:
**Clearbanc is resolving the following financial problems:**
* The first financial problem that Clearbanc is trying to resolve is the **fundraising problem** for new businesses. New founders can have a very difficult time securing funding for their companies by pitching ideas to Venture Capitalists, private equity firms and Banks. It is **time consuming** and there is **no guarantee** since it entirely depends upon the VC's discretion and bias. Also if a VC or Bank chooses to invest, the entire process from initial approval to funding can take several weeks or even months in some cases. Clearbanc has made the funding process **fast and efficient** with the help of **data science and machine learning algorithms** so that the applicants can receive funds in as little as **2 business days**. 
* Another very important issue that they are resolving is the **equity loss** that a founder has to incur when a VC invests in their business. Clearbanc does not take any equity away from the founders but instead uses a **revenue share agreement** to recoup 106% of their investment which involves the **initial investment + 6% fee.**
* Thirdly, the main expense for a new startup or business is the **marketing and inventory expense** because most of the revenue and financing could end up being spent on these. Clearbanc solves this problem by providing a **marketing credit card** to its qualified applicants. They can use this card to pay for digital ads and other items in their marketing budget. They also provide an **inventory funding model** that helps founders free up cash flow to make payments upfront to vendors to lock in inventory. 

**Customers**
* Clearbanc's intended **customers are eCommerce and Consumer SaaS companies**. These companies need to be incorporated with six months of revenue history and 10K average monthly revenue. Global *eCommerce is a $3.5 trillion market* as of 2019 and will see an exponential growth over the next few years and is expected to reach *$5 trillion by 2021.* *Saas industry* is also on a rise with market size expected to reach *$157 billion by the end of 2020.* With their target customers being in these rapidly growing industries, Clearbanc will no doubt continue to expand. They are currently also looking into ways to expand into other types of businesses in order to diversify their portfolio.

**Technology & Process**
* Clearbanc has implemented a variety of technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning, Data Science and Amazon Web Services** to provide effective solutions to their customers. They use many of the services provided by *AWS* and their entire platform is on their *cloud*. They use *data science and machine learning algorithms* to underwrite a customer's business fast and effectively. They have utilized *AWS infrastructure* to create a variety of tools for their customers such as **"The 20 min term sheet"** and **"Clearbanc's Valuation tool"**. Their application process starts with an online questionnaire  that the customers fill out on the Clearbanc's website in order to see if they qualify for financing. It includes questions like, *type of business, average monthly revenue, marketing spend per month and the growth rate.* Once these questions are answered they are asked to plug in their business data onto Clearbanc's platform. This data involves *payment processor data, digital ads, and e-commerce accounts.* AWS helps them manage all of this incoming data and it does it securely and efficiently. The Clearbanc platform is integrated with various *eCommerce, ad and payment platforms such as Shopify, Adword and Stripe* and their *algorithms* assess the data against these platforms and evaluate the  financial health and revenue trajectory of the company. The loan amount can be anywhere from *$10k to $10 million* based on the evaluation of the company. They have basically **automated due diligence and have taken bias out** of the process and it helps them **finance businesses in less than 2 days**. It's the fastest and the most efficient way in the market and the founders can use the funds for a variety of purposes to grow their businesses such as paying for marketing and inventory. It also provides an option to founders to find out the *valuation* of their company. The founders can then use this *valuation* (numerical representation of what Clearbanc thinks their business is worth at a point in time) to see how their business is performing as compared to its competitors and also connects them to potential investors.

## Landscape:
**Domain**
*  Clearbanc is operating in the **capital investment and lending domain** of Fintech. This domain has been dominated by venture capitalists, private equity firms and banks for a long period of time and they have always followed the traditional approach towards financing a business. New entrepreneurs *had to give up equity or pay high interest rates* in order to secure funding and to grow their businesses. Clearbanc intends to *disrupt this trend and wants to give the power back to the founders.* They fund the businesses depending entirely on their merits and have taken the bias out of the equation. They are also taking the uncertainty out of the process and providing quick solutions to the businesses in need for financing.

**Competitors** 
* There are a few other companies in this domain that use a similar approach and  can compete with Clearbanc's AI. One of these companies is *Social Capital* and their business model for funding start ups is similar to Clearbanc. There are also a plenty of *Fintech startups* trying to democratize the investor skills. Some of such startups include *Aingel.ai, Capital Pilot, Crunchdex, Kognetics and Preseries.* Other canadian fintech companies in the lending domain are *FundThrough, Paybright, Lendified, Progressa and Borrowell.* A lot of *Venture Capital firms* have also started investing heavily in AI in the past few years in order to apply a data driven approach to investing. Top five such VC's include *645 Ventures, Ardian, Connetic Ventures, Correlation Ventures and EQT Ventures.*

## Recommendations
**Problems with Clearbanc:**
* Clearbanc has raised significant capital through three funding rounds over the last couple of years but these funding rounds involve offering equity to investors. A major criticism that Clearbanc has received is that their whole business model is to help new companies save their equity and they have been diluting their own. 
* The businesses that they invest in return the initial investment by giving them an agreed upon percentage of their revenue every month. The problem arises if and when these businesses fail and are unable to pay them back. In such cases Clearbanc would incur a major investment loss and it would be hard for them to recover the funds back.
* Their portfolio is limited to only eCommerce and SaaS companies. They need to diversify and include other businesses that  have similar parameters and can be evaluated with their AI.

**Solution**
* In order to resolve the above mentioned problems Clearbanc needs to come up with an **alternative revenue stream** apart from the 6% fee that they charge their customers. This can be achieved by **offering additional services**  that can help them avoid further diluting their equity, protect against delinquent accounts and help diversify. Services such as the **Agency Partner Program** which they launched recently to help businesses with digital marketing and product development. This program can generate additional revenue for Clearbanc since their main customers are new online startups and they can definitely benefit from it. 

* Clearbanc can further tap into the **enterprise solutions** domain of Fintech by providing **Accounting and Statement Reporting** as well. They are already collecting all the necessary information to evaluate a business and provide a valuation. They can build an accounting software using **Amazon Web Services** and integrate into their platform. This software can use their machine learning AI and provide services such as *accounting, statement reporting, financial planning & analysis, internal controls, and enterprise resource planning.* Customers can have an option to sign up for this service after they have received funding or any other business in need of an accounting software can also subscribe. Clearbanc can charge an annual fee and create recurring revenue for their company. Integrated with their AI, this software can also flag any business with a downward trajectory in revenue and can recommend enterprise solutions to help recover which in turn will help Clearbanc recoup their investment faster.
